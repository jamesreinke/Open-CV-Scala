OpenCV2_Cookbook
================

| [Next: Chapter 1>](src/main/scala/opencv2_cookbook/chapter01) |

[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of several hundred algorithms for computer vision and video analysis. 
It started in the late 90’s as a C library; in version 2 a C++ API was added. 

OpenCV can be used in Java Virtal Machine and Android without directly dealing with the native C++ libraries. 
Here we will conventrate on the facilities provided by Bytedeco: 
[JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv) and [OpenCV JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets).

[JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv) is a library based on the 
[JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) that that depends commonly used 
native libraries in the field of computer vision, like OpenCV, to facilitate the development of those applications 
on the Java platform. 
It provides easy-to-use interfaces to grab frames from cameras and audio/video streams, process them, 
and record them back on disk or send them over the network.

The `OpenCV_Cookbok` example project illustrates use of OpenCV, through JavaCV, in JVM. 
It is intended as a companion to the book 
“[OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook](http://www.laganiere.name/opencvCookbook/)” by Robert Laganière. 
The original examples in the Cookbook are written in C++. Here we show how to use JavaCV to perform the same tasks.

The code in the example module is primatily written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), one of the leading JVM languages. 
It can be easily converted to Java and other languages running on JVM, for instance, [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/).
Some of the examples are also provded in Java, for comparison.

Quick Sample
------------

Here is a quick preview that compares an original C++ example with code in Scala and Java using JavaCV wrapper.

Here is the original C++ example that opens an image (without error checking), creates a window,
displays image in the window, and waits for 5 seconds before exiting.

``` c
#include <opencv2/core/core.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>

int main() {
    // read an image
    cv::Mat image = cv::imread("boldt.jpg");

    // create image window named "My Image"
    cv::namedWindow("My Image");

    // show image on window
    cv::imshow("My Image", image);

    // wait key for 5000 ms
    cv::waitKey(5000);

    return 1;
}
```

The above C++ example translated to Scala using JavaCV wrapper, the functional difference is only that image window 
stays open till user coses it:

``` scala
import com.googlecode.javacv.CanvasFrame
import com.googlecode.javacv.cpp.opencv_highgui._

object MyFirstOpenCVApp extends App {   
  // Read an image.
  val image = imread("boldt.jpg")

  // Create image window named "My Image."
  val canvas = new CanvasFrame("My Image", 1)

  // Request closing of the application when the image window is closed.
  canvas.setDefaultCloseOperation(javax.swing.JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)

  // Show image on window.
  canvas.showImage(image)
}
```

Now the same example expressed in a Java. Note that use of JavaCV API is exactly the same in Scala and Java code. 
The only practical difference is that in Java you have to explicily provide type for each variable, in Scala it is optional. 

``` java
import com.googlecode.javacv.CanvasFrame;
import static com.googlecode.javacv.cpp.opencv_core.*;
import static com.googlecode.javacv.cpp.opencv_highgui.*;

public class MyFirstOpenCVApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Read an image.
        final Mat image = imread("boldt.jpg");
    
        // Create image window named "My Image".
        final CanvasFrame canvas = new CanvasFrame("My Image", 1);
    
        // Request closing of the application when the image window is closed.
        canvas.setDefaultCloseOperation(javax.swing.JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
            
        // Show image on window.
        canvas.showImage(image);
    }
}
```

OpenCV Documentation is Your Friend
-----------------------------------

If you are looking for a particular OpenCV operation, use the [OpenCV documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/). 
The Quick Search box is particularly helpful. 
The documentation contains descriptions of alternative ways how C/C++ OpenCV API can be used. 
The JavaCV equivalent maybe similar to the OpenCV C API.


How to use JavaCV Examples
--------------------------

The `OpenCV_Cookbok` example project is intended as a companion to the Cookbook. 
The recommended way is to read the Cookbook and refer to JavaCV examples when in doubt how to translate 
the Cookbook's C++ code to JavaCV. 
The Cookbook provides explanation how the algorithms work. 
The JavaCV examples provide only very brief comments related to specifics of JavaCV API.

Simplest way to use the JavaCV examples is to browse the code located in [src/main] online. 
You can also donload it to you computer either use Git or as a ZIP file.
 
With a minimal setup you can easily execute the examples on you own computer. 
This is one of the benefits of JavaCV - it proved all binaries needed to run OpenCV on various platfoms. 
The setup is explained in README for [Chapter 1](src/main/scala/opencv2_cookbook/chapter01).


Organization of the Example Code
--------------------------------

The code is organized into packages that correspond to chapters in the Cookbook 1st edition, 
for instance [opencv2_cookbook.chapter8](src/main/scala/opencv2_cookbook/chapter08). 
It is quite similar to the 2nd edition. 
Individual examples roughly correspond to sections within each chapter of the book.

[Chapter 1](src/main/scala/opencv2_cookbook/chapter01) describes IDE setup to run the examples, 
gives a basic example of loading and displaying an image, 
and an example of a basic GUI example that does basic image processing.

Why Scala?
----------

[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) was chosen since it is more expressive than Java. 
You can achieve the same result with smaller amount of code. Smaller boilerplate code makes examples easier to read and understand. 
Compiled Scala code is fast, similar to Java and C++. 
Scala supports writing of scripts, code that can be executed without explicit compiling. 
Scala also has a console, called REPL, where single lines of code can be typed in and executed on a spot. 
Both of those features make prototyping of OpenCV-based programs easier in Scala than in Java.
Last but not least, IDE support for Scala reached level of maturity allowing easy creation, modification, 
and execution of Scala code. 
In particular, the [Scala plugin](http://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/)  for [JetBrains IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) 
works very well. 
There is also Scala support for [Eclipse](http://scala-ide.org/index.html) and [NetBeans](https://github.com/dcaoyuan/nbscala).
